# Glühwein

The Glühwein is a custom mechanical keyboard meant to be simple, portable and cheap.

## Portability
It uses a 40% layout and Kailh choc switches to be as small and portable as possible.  
It is supposed to be used with a bluetooth connection, but it depends on the controller used.  

## Simplicity
To keep it simple, it doesn't have any "additional features" like lights, alternative layouts, encoders etc...

## Cheap
The PCB is self produced in some sites like JLCPCB; since it is only possible to order a quantity multiple of 5, a PCB can be used as base to create a sandwitch case.  
The sides can be laser cut or 3d-printed.
